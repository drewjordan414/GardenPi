Data Collection:

Collect a dataset with videos or images of cannabis plants.
The dataset should be diverse, capturing various diseases, various stages of diseases, different lighting conditions, and healthy plants.
Videos can be broken down into frames, allowing you to use individual images for training.
Data Annotation:

Label each frame/image with the corresponding disease or 'healthy' if it doesn't have a disease.
Using tools like Labelbox or VGG Image Annotator (VIA) can be beneficial.
Data Preprocessing:

Resize the images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224 or 299x299 pixels).
Normalize the pixel values (usually between 0 and 1, or standardized with mean subtraction).
Augment the dataset to introduce variability (rotation, zooming, brightness changes, etc.). This can help improve model robustness.
Model Building:

Choose a model architecture suitable for image classification. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are typically used for such tasks.
Consider using transfer learning. This involves taking a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, MobileNet) and fine-tuning it for your specific task. Transfer learning can save time and can also lead to better results if your dataset is not very large.
Training:

Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Use the training set for training the model and the validation set for hyperparameter tuning and to avoid overfitting.
Regularly save model checkpoints. Tools like TensorBoard can help you monitor the training process.
Evaluation:

Once the model has been trained, evaluate its performance on the test set.
Look at metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Depending on the problem, you might prioritize one metric over another. For instance, if false negatives are especially costly, you might prioritize recall.
Deployment:

Once satisfied with the model, you can deploy it in an application.
For real-time video analysis, you might integrate the model into an application that captures video feed, processes frames in real-time, and displays results.
Post-Deployment Monitoring:

Once deployed, it's essential to monitor the model's performance in real-world conditions. If it encounters unseen data or conditions, its performance might vary. Based on feedback, further refinement or retraining might be needed.
